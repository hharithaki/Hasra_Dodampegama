## About Me

Hi! I am Hasra, currently a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.ipab.informatics.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a> supervised by Prof. Mohan Sridharan. I am interested in knowledge representation and reasoning, integration of reasoning and learning, explainable AI, especially in the context of an agent collaborating with other agents without prior coordination.
