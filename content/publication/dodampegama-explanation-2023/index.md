abstract: 'State of the art frameworks for ad hoc teamwork i.e., for enabling an agent
  to collaborate with others “on the fly”, pursue a data-driven approach, using a
  large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents
  and to determine the ad hoc agent’s behavior. It is often difficult to pursue such
  an approach in complex domains due to the lack of sufficient training examples and
  computational resources. In addition, the learned models lack transparency and it
  is difficult to revise the existing knowledge in response to previously unseen changes.
  Our prior architecture enabled an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical
  reasoning with commonsense domain knowledge and predictive models of other agents’
  behavior that are learned from limited examples. In this paper, we enable the ad
  hoc agent to acquire previously unknown domain knowledge governing actions and change,
  and to provide relational descriptions as on-demand explanations of its decisions
  in response to different types of questions. We evaluate the architecture’s knowledge
  acquisition and explanation generation abilities in two simulated benchmark domains:
  Fort Attack and Half Field Offense.'
