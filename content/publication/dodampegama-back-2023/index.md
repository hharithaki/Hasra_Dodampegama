abstract: State of the art methods for ad hoc teamwork, i.e., for collaboration without
  prior coordination, often use a long history of prior observations to model the
  behavior of other agents (or agent types) and to determine the ad hoc agent's behavior.
  In many practical domains, it is difficult to obtain large training datasets, and
  necessary to quickly revise the existing models to account for changes in team composition
  or domain attributes. Our architecture builds on the principles of step-wise refinement
  and ecological rationality to enable an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical
  reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models learned rapidly from
  limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. In the simulated multiagent
  collaboration domain Fort Attack, we experimentally demonstrate that our architecture
  enables an ad hoc agent to adapt to changes in the behavior of other agents, and
  provides enhanced transparency and better performance than a state of the art data-driven
  baseline.
