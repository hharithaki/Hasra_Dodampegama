abstract: 'Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) refers to the problem of enabling an agent to collaborate
  with teammates without prior coordination. State of the art methods in AHT are data-driven,
  using a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other
  agent types and to determine the ad hoc agent’s behavior. These methods are computationally
  expensive, lack transparency, and make it difficult to adapt to previously unseen
  changes. Our recent work introduced an architecture that determined an ad hoc agent’s
  behavior based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain
  knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other
  agents. This paper describes KAT, a knowledge-driven architecture for AHT that substantially
  expands our prior architecture’s capabilities to support: (a) online selection,
  adaptation, and learning of the behavior prediction models; and (b) collaboration
  with teammates in the presence of partial observability and limited communication.
  We illustrate and experimentally evaluate KAT’s capabilities in two simulated benchmark
  domains for multiagent collaboration: Fort Attack and Half Field Offense. We show
  that KAT’s performance is better than a purely knowledge-driven baseline, and comparable
  with or better than a state of the art data-driven baseline, particularly in the
  presence of limited training data, partial observability, and changes in team composition.'
