abstract: An assistive embodied AI agent often has to collaborate with previously
  unseen humans. State of the art frameworks for such ad hoc teamwork use a large
  labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents and
  to determine the ad hoc (i.e., embodied AI) agent’s behavior. These approaches do
  not support rapid incremental revisions or transparency, and the necessary resources
  (e.g., training examples, computation) are not readily available in practical domains.
  Our previous work introduced an architecture that enabled an ad hoc agent to choose
  its actions in simple simulated domains based on non-monotonic logical reasoning
  with prior domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict
  the behavior of other agents. Here, we extend this architecture to enable an ad
  hoc embodied AI agent to collaborate with a human performing household tasks in
  a complex indoor environment, focusing on the ad hoc agent’s ability to identify
  and reason with relevant knowledge, and provide relational descriptions as explanations
  of its behavior and that of the human. We evaluate our architecture’s capabilities
  in VirtualHome, a realistic 3D simulation environment.
