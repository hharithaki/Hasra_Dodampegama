abstract: We present an architecture for ad hoc teamwork, which refers to collaboration
  in a team of agents without prior coordination. State of the art methods for this
  problem often include a data-driven component that uses a long history of prior
  observations to model the behaviour of other agents (or agent types) and to determine
  the ad hoc agent's behaviour. In many practical domains, it is challenging to find
  large training datasets, and necessary to understand and incrementally extend the
  existing models to account for changes in team composition or domain attributes.
  Our architecture combines the principles of knowledge-based and data-driven reasoning
  and learning. Specifically, we enable an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical
  reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and incrementally-updated simple
  predictive models of other agents' behaviour. We use the benchmark simulated multi-agent
  collaboration domain Fort Attack to demonstrate that our architecture supports adaptation
  to unforeseen changes, incremental learning and revision of models of other agents'
  behaviour from limited samples, transparency in the ad hoc agent's decision making,
  and better performance than a data-driven baseline.
