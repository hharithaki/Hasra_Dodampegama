abstract: 'This paper describes an architecture for ad hoc teamwork, i.e., to enable
  an agent to collaborate with other agents “on the fly". State of the art frameworks
  for ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach, using a large labeled dataset
  of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents and to determine the
  ad hoc agent’s behavior. These models are computationally expensive to learn, lack
  transparency, and make it difficult to recognize and adapt to previously unseen
  changes. In a departure from existing work, we introduce an architecture for ad
  hoc teamwork that performs non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense
  domain knowledge and models that are learned and revised rapidly from limited examples
  to predict the behavior of other agents. In addition, the architecture enables the
  agent to provide relational descriptions as on-demand explanations of its decisions
  and beliefs in response to different types of questions. We evaluate the architecture’s
  capabilities in two benchmark multiagent collaboration domains: Fort Attack and
  Half field Offense, in comparison with data-driven and knowledge-driven baselines.'
