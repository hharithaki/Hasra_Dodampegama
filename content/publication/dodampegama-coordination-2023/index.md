abstract: 'Ad hoc teamwork focuses on enabling an agent to collaborate with others
  without prior coordination. This is a central problem in the coordination of open
  multiagent systems in many practical applications. Data-driven learning methods
  represent the state of the art in ad hoc teamwork. They use a large labeled dataset
  of prior observations to model the behavior of other agent types and to determine
  the ad hoc agent’s behavior. These methods are computationally expensive, lack transparency,
  and make it difficult to adapt to changes in team composition. Our recent work introduced
  an architecture that determined an ad hoc agent’s behavior based on non-monotonic
  logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models that were learned
  from limited examples to predict other agents’ behavior. In this paper, we expand
  the architecture’s capabilities, supporting: (a) online adaptation and choice of
  learned models of other agents’ behavior; and (b) collaboration in the presence
  of partial observability and limited communication. Experimental evaluation in two
  simulated benchmark domains for ad hoc teamwork demonstrates performance comparable
  or better than state of the art data-driven baselines in simple and complex scenarios,
  particularly in the presence of limited training data, partial observability, and
  changes in team composition.'
