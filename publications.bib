	abstract = {State of the art methods for ad hoc teamwork, i.e., for collaboration without prior coordination, often use a long history of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents (or agent types) and to determine the ad hoc agent's behavior. In many practical domains, it is difficult to obtain large training datasets, and necessary to quickly revise the existing models to account for changes in team composition or domain attributes. Our architecture builds on the principles of step-wise refinement and ecological rationality to enable an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models learned rapidly from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. In the simulated multiagent collaboration domain Fort Attack, we experimentally demonstrate that our architecture enables an ad hoc agent to adapt to changes in the behavior of other agents, and provides enhanced transparency and better performance than a state of the art data-driven baseline.},

	abstract = {Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) refers to the problem of enabling an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination. State of the art methods in AHT are data-driven, using a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agent types and to determine the ad hoc agent’s behavior. These methods are computationally expensive, lack transparency, and make it difficult to adapt to previously unseen changes. Our recent work introduced an architecture that determined an ad hoc agent’s behavior based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. This paper describes KAT, a knowledge-driven architecture for AHT that substantially expands our prior architecture’s capabilities to support: (a) online selection, adaptation, and learning of the behavior prediction models; and (b) collaboration with teammates in the presence of partial observability and limited communication. We illustrate and experimentally evaluate KAT’s capabilities in two simulated benchmark domains for multiagent collaboration: Fort Attack and Half Field Offense. We show that KAT’s performance is better than a purely knowledge-driven baseline, and comparable with or better than a state of the art data-driven baseline, particularly in the presence of limited training data, partial observability, and changes in team composition.},

State of the art frameworks for such ad hoc teamwork use a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agents and to determine the ad hoc (i.e., embodied AI) agent’s behavior. These approaches do not support rapid incremental revisions or transparency, and the necessary resources (e.g., training examples, computation) are not readily available in practical domains. Our previous work introduced an architecture that enabled an ad hoc agent to choose its actions in simple simulated domains based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. Here, we extend this architecture to enable an ad hoc embodied AI agent to collaborate with a human performing household tasks in a complex indoor environment, focusing on the ad hoc agent’s ability to identify and reason with relevant knowledge, and provide relational descriptions as explanations of its behavior and that of the human. We evaluate our architecture’s capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic 3D simulation environment.},

Our prior architecture enabled an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical reasoning with commonsense domain knowledge and predictive models of other agents’ behavior that are learned from limited examples. In this paper, we enable the ad hoc agent to acquire previously unknown domain knowledge governing actions and change, and to provide relational descriptions as on-demand explanations of its decisions in response to different types of questions.

State of the art methods for this problem often include a data-driven component that uses a long history of prior observations to model the behaviour of other agents (or agent types) and to determine the ad hoc agent's behaviour. In many practical domains, it is challenging to find large training datasets, and necessary to understand and incrementally extend the existing models to account for changes in team composition or domain attributes. Our architecture combines the principles of knowledge-based and data-driven reasoning and learning. Specifically, we enable an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and incrementally-updated simple predictive models of other agents' behaviour. We use the benchmark simulated multi-agent collaboration domain Fort Attack to demonstrate that our architecture supports adaptation to unforeseen changes, incremental learning and revision of models of other agents' behaviour from limited samples, transparency in the ad hoc agent's decision making, and better performance than a data-driven baseline.},

This is a central problem in the coordination of open multiagent systems in many practical applications. Data-driven learning methods represent the state of the art in ad hoc teamwork. They use a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agent types and to determine the ad hoc agent’s behavior. These methods are computationally expensive, lack transparency, and make it difficult to adapt to changes in team composition.
